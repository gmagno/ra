1) If you do not have CMake installed, compilation won't even start. Then, follow the instructions on the following link. This can take a while (enjoy a cup of coffee):
https://vitux.com/how-to-install-cmake-on-ubuntu-18-04/

2) Clone the repo recursively (use --recursive to include content on pybind11 and eigen)
git clone --recursive Â https://github.com/gmagno/ra.git

3) Navigate to the folder
cd/ra

4) Create a virtual environment
python3 -m .venv

5) Activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate

6) install dependencies in "requrements.txt" on your virtual environment. 
If pip install requirements.txt does not work, then do it for each dependency. For example pip install matplotlib==3.1.1 

7) compile the code (First compilation can take a while)
make build

8) If compilation is successful run a test case. This will run 1000 rays through a very simple room. As it is programed you won't see any results,
but a bunch of messages will appear in the console with the progress of the calculations. The test case is a simple room with two sources.
So, you'll see two progresses bar running as two separate ray tracings will (hopefully) occur. In order to run this test case type: "make run" or 
"python ra/run_simu.py" on
command line.
